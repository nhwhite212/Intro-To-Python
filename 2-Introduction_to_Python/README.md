## Introduction to Python

This is a set of notes used for teaching Python to students that have never used Python, or programmed in any language. In a usual semester, it takes approximately 4 weeks (meeting twice a week for an hour) to go through the material, for a freshmen undergraduate class. 

## Additional Resources for Learning Python

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/): A great introduction to programming and Python. It targets complete beginners, and can be tedious at times but it is universally considered one of the standard textbooks for learning Python. You can buy the print version, or read it online for free
* [Code Academy, Python class](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python): This is a useful interactive tutorial for beginners, who are trying to understand programming in general, and Python in particular
* [Googleâ€™s Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
* [Official Python 2 Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Useful iPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks): A wide variety of useful tutorials in iPython Notebooks for a wide variety of topics
* [Quantitative Economics](http://quant-econ.net/py/): An introduction to scientific computing using Python, by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski
* [How To Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#t-o-c): An interactive guide to programming and Python
* The following Coursera courses [Getting Started with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python), [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data), [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data), [Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases), [Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-capstone) are well-alinged with the objectives of our class. Similarly, this book on Python [Python for Informatics: Exploring Information](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) is also a great supplement for our class.
