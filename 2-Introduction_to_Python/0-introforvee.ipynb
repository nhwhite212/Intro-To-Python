    "Jupyter Notebooks are an easy way to present material, since the user can see the results of their efforts immediately. Each notebook consists of \"cells\", a cell can just be text to display (like this cell), or can be python code. The user \"executes\" a cell by hitting the shift key and the enter key (i.e. shift-enter). The code in a cell can be easily changed, by just editting it, and then hitting shift-enter again. Variables can be created in one cell and referenced in a later cell, allowing the cells to be building blocks for larger systems.\n",

Students can submit homeworks as noebooks, and researchers can distribute their research as notebooks. Although initially designed for the python programmimg language, jupyter notebooks now support a variety of other common languages, like \"R\", \"scala\",...g "
