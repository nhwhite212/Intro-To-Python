    "Jupyter Notebooks are an easy way to present material, since the user can see the results of their efforts immediately. Each notebook consists of \"cells\", a cell can just be text to display (like this cell), or can be python code. The user \"executes\" a cell by hitting the shift key and the enter key (i.e. shift-enter). The code in a cell can be easily changed, by just editting it, and then hitting shift-enter again. Variables can be created in one cell and referenced in a later cell, allowing the cells to be building blocks for larger systems."
