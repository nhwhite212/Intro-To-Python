# So, let's take a look at our code from last time:
print("180 cm is", int(180//30.48), "feet and", round(180%30.48 / 2.54, 1) , "inches")


# We will now start introducing variables
centimeters = 180
feet = int(centimeters / 30.48)
inches = int(centimeters % 30.48 / 2.54)
print(centimeters, "cm is", feet, "ft and", inches, "inches")


# Now let's introduce more variables to eliminate the "magic numbers" 30.48 and 2.54
cm_per_foot = 30.48
cm_per_in = 2.54
# And now let's modify our code from above
centimeters = 180
feet = int(centimeters / cm_per_foot)
inches = int(centimeters % cm_per_foot / cm_per_in)
print(centimeters, "cm is", feet, "ft and", inches, "inches")

# And if we want to use round instead of int:
inches = round(centimeters % cm_per_foot / cm_per_in,1)
print(centimeters, "cm is", feet, "ft and", inches, "inches")
