Technology stocks are suffering one of their worst beatings in years, 
as investors reassess a sector that has been considered the growth 
engine of the global economy but now faces the prospect of greater

fell 2.9% Tuesday. That selloff carried over to the broader market, 
where the S&P 500 index slumped 1.7%.  The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average fell 1.4%, giving back some of Mondayâ€™s 2.8% rebound.
